# Pine Script Examples Collection

This directory contains a comprehensive collection of Pine Script indicators organized by complexity level. These examples serve as references for the Pine Script development agents and provide practical implementations of popular trading concepts.

## Organization Structure

### `/simple/` - Basic Indicators (< 100 lines)
Simple, focused indicators that demonstrate core concepts without excessive complexity.

- **vwap-basic.pine** - Volume Weighted Average Price with standard deviation bands
- **mtf-trend-alignment.pine** - Multi-timeframe trend alignment indicator
- **pivot-points-traditional.pine** - Traditional, Fibonacci, and Camarilla pivot points

### `/intermediate/` - Medium Complexity (100-300 lines)
More sophisticated indicators with multiple features and better user experience.

- **multi-timeframe-rsi.pine** - RSI with multiple timeframe analysis
- **market-structure-bos-choch.pine** - Break of Structure and Change of Character detection
- **volume-profile-session.pine** - Session-based volume profile with POC and value areas
- **liquidity-zones-ict.pine** - ICT liquidity pool detection with sweep alerts
- **dynamic-support-resistance.pine** - Advanced dynamic S&R with strength calculation
- **rsi-divergence-scanner.pine** - Complete RSI divergence detection (regular & hidden)

### `/advanced/` - Complex Indicators (> 300 lines)
Comprehensive, production-ready indicators with advanced features and professional UX.

- **dynamic-swing-anchored-vwap.pine** - Swing-anchored VWAP with multiple anchor points
- **smart-money-concepts-suite.pine** - Complete SMC toolkit (BOS, CHoCH, OB, FVG, Liquidity)
- **comprehensive-volume-profile.pine** - Advanced volume profile with statistics and multi-timeframe
- **multi-timeframe-analysis-suite.pine** - Complete MTF trend & momentum analysis with signals

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. ICT (Inner Circle Trader) Concepts
- **Order Blocks**: Institutional footprint identification
- **Fair Value Gaps**: Price imbalances that act as magnets
- **Liquidity Zones**: Areas where stops are likely clustered
- **Market Structure**: BOS (Break of Structure) and CHoCH (Change of Character)

### 2. Volume Analysis
- **Volume Profile**: Price-volume distribution analysis
- **VWAP**: Volume Weighted Average Price calculations
- **POC**: Point of Control identification
- **Value Area**: Statistical volume distribution zones

### 3. Support & Resistance
- **Pivot Points**: Mathematical support/resistance levels
- **Dynamic Levels**: Adaptive support/resistance based on price action
- **Zone Trading**: Support/resistance as zones rather than lines
- **Strength Calculation**: Rating levels based on multiple touches

### 4. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- **Trend Alignment**: Checking trend agreement across timeframes
- **Higher Timeframe Context**: Using HTF data for better decisions
- **Non-Repainting Implementation**: Proper use of `request.security()`

### 5. Technical Features
- **Pine Script v6**: All examples use the latest version
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient array management and drawing limits
- **User Experience**: Professional inputs, colors, and table displays
- **Alert Systems**: Comprehensive alert conditions
- **Error Handling**: Proper `na` value handling and edge cases

## Code Quality Standards

All examples follow these standards:

✅ **Pine Script v6 Syntax**: Latest version with modern features  
✅ **No Repainting**: Proper historical/realtime handling  
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient memory and drawing usage  
✅ **Professional UX**: Intuitive inputs with tooltips and grouping  
✅ **Comprehensive Alerts**: Multiple alert conditions where appropriate  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust `na` value and edge case handling  
✅ **Clean Code**: Well-commented and structured code  
✅ **Documentation**: Clear descriptions and usage instructions  

## Usage Guidelines

### For Learning
- Start with **simple** examples to understand core concepts
- Progress to **intermediate** for practical implementations
- Study **advanced** examples for production-quality code

### For Development
- Use examples as starting points for custom indicators
- Copy and modify code patterns for your specific needs
- Reference for best practices in Pine Script development

### For Agents
- Templates for common indicator types
- Reference implementations for complex concepts
- Code patterns for specific trading methodologies

## Popular Concepts Reference

### ICT Trading
The examples include comprehensive ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts:
- Order blocks identify institutional buying/selling areas
- Fair value gaps show price imbalances
- Liquidity zones mark areas where stops cluster
- Market structure breaks indicate trend changes

### Volume Profile
Volume profile analysis shows where the most trading activity occurred:
- POC (Point of Control) is the price with highest volume
- Value Area contains 70% of total volume (configurable)
- VWAP provides volume-weighted average price
- Session profiles reset on time boundaries

### Smart Money Concepts
Advanced traders use these concepts to follow institutional money:
- Market structure breaks show trend changes
- Order blocks indicate where institutions entered
- Liquidity sweeps target retail stop losses
- Fair value gaps provide retracement targets

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- All examples respect TradingView's drawing limits
- Arrays are properly managed to prevent memory issues
- Complex calculations are optimized for speed
- Drawing objects are cleaned up to prevent accumulation

### Repainting Prevention
- Uses `barstate.isconfirmed` for historical consistency
- Proper `lookahead` settings in `request.security()`
- Avoids real-time calculations that change historical results

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive `na` value checking
- Edge case handling for empty arrays
- Division by zero prevention
- Graceful degradation when data is insufficient

## Contributing

When adding new examples:
1. Follow the complexity guidelines for folder placement
2. Maintain the established code quality standards
3. Include comprehensive comments and documentation
4. Test thoroughly across different market conditions
5. Ensure no repainting issues exist

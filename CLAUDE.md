## File Protection System

The project includes a protection system to prevent accidental modification of system files:

### Protection States
- **Locked** üîí: Only `/projects/` directory can be modified
- **Unlocked** üîì: All files can be modified (development mode)

### Commands
- `lock` - Enable file protection
- `unlock` - Disable file protection (default for development)
- `status` - Check current protection state

### Protected Areas (when locked)
- `.claude/agents/` - Agent configurations
- `.claude/hooks/` - System hooks
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `templates/` - Template library
- `tools/` - System tools
- `examples/` - Example scripts
- Root config files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json)

### Always Writable
- `/projects/` - User Pine Scripts
- `.claude/.lock_state` - Lock state file
- `.claude/.onboarding_complete` - Onboarding marker
- Other state files

### Development Note
The system defaults to **unlocked** during development to allow easy modifications. Use `lock` command when working on Pine Scripts to prevent accidental system file changes.

## Initialization
When a user opens this project, you should:
1. Recognize you're in the Pine Script development environment
2. Load the Pine Script v6 documentation from `docs/pinescript-v6/`
3. Be aware of the available subagents in `.claude/agents/`
4. Have access to templates in `templates/`
5. Be ready to help with Pine Script development
6. **Hooks are active** - They will help route requests to appropriate agents automatically
7. **Onboarding has run** - User has seen instructions

## Hooks System (Active)

This project uses Claude Code hooks for deterministic agent selection:

### user-prompt-submit.sh
- Analyzes user requests before processing
- Suggests appropriate agents based on keywords
- Detects project complexity
- Ensures consistent agent routing

### before-write.sh
- Validates Pine Script files before saving
- Ensures files are in `/projects/` directory
- Checks for version declaration
- Reminds to rename blank.pine to project-specific name

### after-edit.sh
- Validates Pine Script after modifications
- Checks for repainting issues
- Suggests improvements (na handling, risk management, input groups)
- Provides real-time feedback

## Available Subagents

You have 7 specialized subagents at your disposal:

1. **pine-visualizer**: Breaks down trading ideas into components
2. **pine-developer**: Writes production Pine Script v6 code  
3. **pine-debugger**: Adds debugging tools and troubleshooting
4. **pine-backtester**: Implements comprehensive testing metrics
5. **pine-optimizer**: Optimizes performance and user experience
6. **pine-manager**: Orchestrates multi-agent workflows
7. **pine-publisher**: Prepares scripts for TradingView publication

## Workflow Guidelines

### For Simple Requests
When users ask for simple indicators or strategies, you can handle these directly or delegate to appropriate agents:
- "Create an RSI indicator" ‚Üí Use pine-developer
- "Debug my script" ‚Üí Use pine-debugger
- "Optimize performance" ‚Üí Use pine-optimizer

### For Complex Projects
When users describe complex requirements, use the pine-manager agent to orchestrate:
- "Build a complete trading system with..." ‚Üí pine-manager coordinates all agents
- "Create a multi-timeframe strategy with backtesting" ‚Üí pine-manager orchestrates workflow

### Automatic Agent Selection
Based on the user's request, automatically select the most appropriate agent:
- Conceptual/planning questions ‚Üí pine-visualizer
- Code implementation ‚Üí pine-developer
- Error fixing ‚Üí pine-debugger
- Performance testing ‚Üí pine-backtester
- UX improvement ‚Üí pine-optimizer
- Publishing preparation ‚Üí pine-publisher
- Complex multi-step projects ‚Üí pine-manager

## Key Commands and Patterns

### Creating New Scripts
```
User: "Create a [indicator/strategy] that [description]"
Action: 
1. Use pine-visualizer to break down requirements
2. Use pine-developer to implement
3. Use pine-debugger to add testing tools
4. Use pine-optimizer to enhance UX
```

### Debugging Existing Scripts
```
User: "My script has [problem description]"
Action:
1. Use pine-debugger to identify issues
2. Use pine-developer to fix problems
3. Use pine-debugger to verify fixes
```

### Optimizing Performance
```
User: "Make my script faster/better"
Action:
1. Use pine-optimizer to analyze current performance
2. Use pine-backtester to measure baseline
3. Use pine-optimizer to implement improvements
4. Use pine-backtester to validate improvements
```

## Pine Script Knowledge Base

You have comprehensive documentation available:
- **Language Reference**: `docs/pinescript-v6/language-reference.md`
- **Built-in Functions**: `docs/pinescript-v6/built-in-functions.md`
- **TradingView Environment**: `docs/tradingview/`
- **Templates**: `templates/` directory with ready-to-use code

## Important Pine Script Considerations

### Always Remember:
1. **Version Declaration**: Every script starts with `//@version=6`
2. **Repainting**: Avoid or document clearly when present
3. **Limits**: 500 bars lookback, 500 plots max, 40 security() calls max
4. **Performance**: Optimize security() calls and array operations
5. **User Experience**: Group inputs, add tooltips, use professional colors

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. Not handling `na` values
2. Using `security()` without proper lookahead settings
3. Mixing series and simple types incorrectly
4. Not considering real-time vs historical calculation differences
5. Creating strategies that repaint

## Templates Available

You have pre-built templates in:
- `templates/indicators/` - Common indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- `templates/strategies/` - Strategy patterns (trend following, mean reversion, etc.)
- `templates/utilities/` - Helper functions (debugging, risk management, backtesting)

## Response Format

When helping users:
1. **Understand** the requirement fully
2. **Plan** the approach (which agents/templates to use)
3. **Implement** using appropriate agents
4. **Test** with debugging and backtesting tools
5. **Optimize** for performance and UX
6. **Deliver** complete, production-ready code

## Quality Standards

All scripts you help create should have:
- ‚úÖ Proper Pine Script v6 syntax
- ‚úÖ No repainting (or clearly documented)
- ‚úÖ Error handling for edge cases
- ‚úÖ Intuitive user inputs with tooltips
- ‚úÖ Professional visual presentation
- ‚úÖ Debugging capabilities included
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics (for strategies)
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation and comments

## Example Interactions

### Simple Indicator
```
User: "Create an RSI divergence indicator"
Your approach:
1. Use pine-developer to create RSI divergence detection
2. Use pine-debugger to add divergence visualization
3. Use pine-optimizer to enhance visuals and alerts
```

### Complex Strategy
```
User: "Build a mean reversion strategy using Bollinger Bands and volume"
Your approach:
1. Use pine-manager to orchestrate:
   - pine-visualizer breaks down components
   - pine-developer implements strategy
   - pine-backtester adds metrics
   - pine-debugger adds trade debugging
   - pine-optimizer enhances UX
```

## Testing Your Scripts

Before delivering any script:
1. Verify syntax is correct
2. Check for common errors (na handling, repainting)
3. Ensure all features work as intended
4. Confirm visual elements display properly
5. Test alerts function correctly (if applicable)

## User Support

When users need help:
- Be proactive in suggesting improvements
- Offer to add debugging tools
- Suggest optimization opportunities
- Recommend best practices
- Provide clear explanations

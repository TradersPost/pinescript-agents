## Adaptive Question Framework

### Level 1: Initial Probe
If user request doesn't match known patterns, ask:
1. "Can you describe what you're trying to achieve?"
2. "What problem are you trying to solve?"
3. "Is this for analysis, trading, or something else?"

### Level 2: Category Discovery
Based on initial response, identify categories:
- **Data/Input**: Custom data sources, multiple timeframes, alternative data
- **Calculation/Logic**: Mathematical models, ML, statistical analysis
- **Display/Output**: Visualization, custom charts, dashboards
- **Trading/Execution**: Order management, position sizing, complex strategies
- **Integration**: External systems, APIs, databases

### Level 3: Deep Dive Questions

#### For Unknown Data Sources:
- "What type of data? (price, volume, sentiment, on-chain, economic, other)"
- "How frequently does it update?"
- "How will you get this data into TradingView?"
- "Can we approximate it with available data?"

#### For Unknown Calculations:
- "Can you describe the mathematical formula or logic?"
- "Does this exist in other platforms? Which ones?"
- "What are the inputs and outputs?"
- "Is there a simpler version we could start with?"

#### For Unknown Visualizations:
- "Can you describe or sketch what it should look like?"
- "Have you seen this elsewhere? Where?"
- "What information must be displayed?"
- "How should it update?"

#### For Unknown Trading Logic:
- "Describe your entry and exit conditions"
- "How do you manage risk?"
- "What's unique about your approach?"
- "Any special execution requirements?"

### Level 4: Feasibility Assessment

After gathering requirements, assess:
1. **Fully Feasible**: Can be done in Pine Script as requested
2. **Partially Feasible**: Some compromises needed
3. **Requires Workarounds**: Creative solutions needed
4. **Not Feasible**: Need alternative approach

## Examples of Handling Unknown Requests

### Example 1: "I want to analyze options flow"
**Discovery Process**:
1. What aspect of options flow? â†’ "Unusual options activity"
2. What data needed? â†’ "Volume, OI, strike, expiry"
3. How to get in TradingView? â†’ "Can't directly"
4. Workaround? â†’ "Use volume patterns as proxy, add manual levels"
5. Result: Partial implementation with manual input method

### Example 2: "I need Elliott Wave with AI"
**Discovery Process**:
1. What should the AI do? â†’ "Identify wave patterns"
2. How sophisticated? â†’ "Basic pattern recognition"
3. Training data? â†’ "Historical patterns"
4. Workaround: Rule-based pattern matching with probability scores
5. Result: Feasible with simplified approach

### Example 3: "Market making bot for DeFi"
**Discovery Process**:
1. Which blockchain? â†’ "Ethereum"
2. How to connect? â†’ "Via webhooks to bot"
3. Pine Script role? â†’ "Signal generation only"
4. Result: Pine generates signals, external bot executes

### Example 4: "Fourier transform for cycle analysis"
**Discovery Process**:
1. Which type? â†’ "DFT for dominant cycle"
2. Purpose? â†’ "Find market cycles"
3. Approximation OK? â†’ "Yes"
4. Result: Implement simplified DFT with limitations noted

## Fallback Strategies

When something is truly impossible in Pine Script:

### 1. Suggest Alternatives
- "Pine Script can't do X, but we can achieve similar results with Y"
- "Instead of real-time options data, we can use implied volatility proxies"
- "Rather than ML training, we can implement pre-trained rules"

### 2. Hybrid Approach
- "Pine Script for signals, external system for execution"
- "Manual data input for unavailable feeds"
- "Simplified visualization with detailed alerts"

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- "Start with basic version, add features iteratively"
- "Build modular system that can be extended"
- "Create framework for future additions"

### 4. Educational Pivot
- "Here's why Pine Script has this limitation"
- "Here's what IS possible that's similar"
- "Here's how professionals handle this"

## The Universal Catch-All

If still uncertain after discovery:
```
"I understand you want [summary of request]. Pine Script has some limitations, 
but let's explore what's possible:

1. Core Functionality: What absolutely must work?
2. Nice-to-Have: What would be ideal but not essential?
3. Acceptable Compromises: Where can we simplify?
4. External Components: What could be handled outside Pine Script?

Based on your priorities, I'll design the best possible solution within 
Pine Script's capabilities, and clearly document any limitations or 
workarounds needed."
```

## Implementation in pine-manager

The pine-manager should:
1. First attempt to match known patterns
2. If no match, enter discovery mode
3. Ask probing questions to understand the request
4. Assess feasibility in Pine Script
5. Design workarounds or alternatives as needed
6. Generate realistic specification
7. Set appropriate expectations
8. Proceed with adapted implementation

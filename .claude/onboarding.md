# Pine Script Assistant - Onboarding Process

## Automatic Onboarding Flow

### 1. First Launch Detection
When Claude Code starts, the startup hook checks for `.claude/.onboarding_complete`:
- **Not found** → First-time user → Show full onboarding
- **Found** → Returning user → Show brief status

### 2. First-Time User Experience

```

## State Management

### Files Created During Onboarding:

1. **`.claude/.onboarding_complete`**
   - Marker file indicating onboarding shown
   - Created after first run

2. **`.claude/.state.json`**
   ```json
   {
     "onboarded": true,
     "first_run": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "projects_created": 0,
     "last_project": null
   }
   ```

3. **`projects/blank.pine`**
   - Created if missing
   - Ready for first project

## Quick Start Examples

After onboarding, users can immediately:

### Example 1: Direct Request
**User**: "Create an RSI indicator"
**System**: Immediately starts project → No additional questions needed

### Example 2: Video Analysis
**User**: "Analyze this: youtube.com/watch?v=..."
**System**: Runs video analyzer → Shows summary → Proceeds with development

### Example 3: Complex Request
**User**: "I need a market profile"
**System**: Enters discovery mode → Asks clarifying questions → Implements

## Ensuring Onboarding Runs

The startup hook is registered in `.claude/hooks.json`:
```json
{
  "startup": ".claude/hooks/startup.sh",
  ...
}
```

This ensures:
1. Hook runs when Claude Code initializes
2. Onboarding shows on first use
3. Status shows on return visits
4. System is always ready

1. Delete `.claude/.onboarding_complete`

To simulate returning user:
1. Ensure `.claude/.onboarding_complete` exists
